In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVlLBa9ybXs&t=351s), during a card trick, magician Shawn Farquhar states 
that he learned from magician Penn Jillete that if you perfectly riffle shuffle a deck of cards seven times, it will go 
back to its original order.

In this other [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9-b-QJZdVA), mathematician Matt Parker, clarifies that it should
actually take eight (or fifty two) shuffles to return the deck of cards to its original order, explaining why this
happens.

Naturally, I coded my own shuffler just to see what happens.
